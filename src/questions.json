            "answer": 1,

            "answer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clozapine carries a 1-2% risk of agranulocytosis, a potentially fatal condition where white blood cell count drops dramatically. This is why patients on clozapine require regular blood monitoring (weekly for the first 6 months, then biweekly). Despite this risk, clozapine is highly effective for treatment-resistant schizophrenia."

            "answer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sodium depletion increases lithium toxicity because lithium and sodium compete for reabsorption in the kidneys. When sodium levels are low, the kidneys retain more lithium, leading to toxic levels. This is why patients on lithium should maintain adequate sodium intake and stay hydrated."
